# typo3_extbase_model
Repository for the tutorial from Slavlee about Extbase in Typo3 v11

Link to tutorial on youtube from Slavee (channel: T3 Campus): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN9_AwqpE2o

I followed the tutorial and got this code present in this repository.

1. Replace composer.json, with the one provided. This will install Typo3 v11.5 and the addon myfirstgame.
2. In Typo3 backend goto Maintenance -> Analyze Database Structure  and let Typo3 create the tables.
